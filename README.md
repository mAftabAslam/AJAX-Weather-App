# Weather Application

## Description
This is a simple weather application that fetches weather information from a public API based on user input (city name) using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML). The application displays the fetched weather data on the webpage without reloading the page.

## How to Run the Application Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project directory in your code editor.
3. Ensure you have a text editor or IDE installed, as well as a web browser.
4. Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up for an account and generating a key.
5. Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the `script.js` file with your actual API key obtained from OpenWeatherMap.
6. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
7. Enter the name of the city for which you want to check the weather in the input field.
8. Click on the "Get Weather" button to fetch and display the weather information for the specified city.
9. The fetched weather information will be displayed on the webpage without reloading the page.

## Additional Notes
- The application uses AJAX to asynchronously fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Ensure you have a stable internet connection to fetch data from the API.
- Customize the styling of the webpage using the provided CSS file or by modifying the CSS code.
- Refer to the OpenWeatherMap documentation for more information on their API endpoints and usage.
